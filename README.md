einDa-skin
==========

This is a free skin that you can use freely and even can modify it if you consider it necessary.

It’s the first version, so it may have bugs.

The skin is a “mobile-first” design, because the users use them as main platform.  However, I haven’t neglected the desktop skin quality.
